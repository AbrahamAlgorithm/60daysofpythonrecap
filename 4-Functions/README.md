# Day 5: Exploring String Functions in Python

Welcome to Day 5 of my 60 Days of Python Recap journey! ðŸš€ On this day, I delved into the powerful world of string functions in Python.

## Key Concepts Covered

### 1. String Methods
I explored various built-in string methods that Python offers. These methods provide versatile ways to manipulate and analyze strings.

#### Example:
```python
text = "Hello, Python!"
uppercase_text = text.upper()
print(uppercase_text)
```
### 2. String Slicing
Understanding how to slice and index strings allows for precise extraction of substrings and characters.

#### Example:
```python
sentence = "Learning Python is fun!"
substring = sentence[9:15]
print(substring)
```
### 3. String Formatting
I learned about different ways to format strings, including f-strings, format(), and %-formatting.

#### Example:
```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
formatted_string = f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old."
print(formatted_string)
