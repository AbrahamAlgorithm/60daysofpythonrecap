Welcome to my 60 Days of Python Recap repository! üöÄ

## Introduction

I've embarked on a journey to revisit and reinforce my Python knowledge over the next 60 days. This repository will serve as a collection of all the code snippets, projects, and exercises I complete during this period.

## Goals

- Review fundamental Python concepts
- Explore advanced topics
- Work on coding exercises and projects
- Build a strong foundation for future Python development

## Structure

The repository is organized by days, and each day's code is placed in its respective directory. Feel free to explore and learn along with me!

## Progress

- [Day 1: Problem Solving](Day01/)
- [Day 2: Looping](Day02/)
- ...

## Resources

I'll be using various resources, tutorials, and documentation during this journey. Here are some of the main references:

- [Official Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)
- Youtube
