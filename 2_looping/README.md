# Day 2: Looping in Python

Welcome to Day 2 of my 60 Days of Python Recap journey! ðŸš€ Today, I delved into the fascinating world of loops in Python.

## Key Concepts Covered

### 1. `for` Loops

In Python, the `for` loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string). During Day 2, I explored the syntax of `for` loops and their application in various scenarios.

### 2. `while` Loops

The `while` loop in Python is another powerful tool for iteration. Unlike the `for` loop, the `while` loop continues to execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. During Day 2, I explored the syntax of `while` loops and their applications.
